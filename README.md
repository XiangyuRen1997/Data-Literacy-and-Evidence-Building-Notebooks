# Data-Literacy-and-Evidence-Building-Notebooks

## The Jupyter notebooks cover the following topics using Python (and SQL):
1.	Data Exploration: This notebook shows how to load datasets, conduct exploratory analysis, subset data, and generate descriptive statistics.
2.	Data Linkage: This notebook demonstrates different join operations using Python and SQL.
3.	Data Measurement: This notebook shows how to define degree completers, non-completers, and degree-pursuers, and develops several job quality measures.
4.	Data Visualization: This notebook covers how to create informative visualizations by using matplotlib and seaborn library, showcasing boxplots, countplots, lineplots, and barplots.
These notebooks will help readers gain a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and manipulation techniques.
 
### Data Exploration:
•	Loading python libraries//
•	Loading datasets//
•	Exploring data structure, using the example of the 2015 cohort//
•	Checking dataset variables and size//
•	Subsetting data, with examples of specific study majors//
•	Generating descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, counts, and quantiles, illustrated with the "year7earnings" variable//
•	Identifying missing values in "year7earnings"//
### Data Linkage Python & SQL - similar structure just with different languages!
•	Introducing cross-section data, consisting of three datasets: master, employment, and education
•	Establishing database connection and loading data to the database 
•	Demonstrating how to left join master with employment in SQL language
•	Performing the inner join of master with employment in SQL language, leading to missing entries for those without employment in the combined dataset
•	Right merging master with education in Python
### Measurement:
•	Defining degree completers, non-completers, and degree pursuers
•	Assessing the quality of work by examining year 7 earnings, the number of jobs, high-earning jobs, employment duration, average earnings per employment quarters under different completion status.
•	Analyzing year 7 earnings, the number of jobs, high earning jobs, employment duration, average earnings per employment quarters for different majors in different completion status.
### Data Visualization
•	Introducing the visualization packages: matplotlib and seaborn.
•	Explaining how to create simple and information visualizations.
•	Demonstrating how to create a boxplot with an example of earnings distributions by major.
•	Demonstrating how to create a count plot with an example of missingness in earnings by major.
•	Demonstrating how to create a line plot with an example of time trends in earnings by major.
•	Demonstrating how to create a bar chart with an example of median earnings by major and completion status.
