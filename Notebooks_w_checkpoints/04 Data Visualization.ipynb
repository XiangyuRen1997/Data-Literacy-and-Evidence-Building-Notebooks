    "In this notebook, we will show job quality for students in the 2015 Syntucky cohort by using various visualizations, including boxplot, countplot, line plot, and bar chart. You may find that the Python code we use to create visualizations is lengthy. However, once you write the visualization code in Python, it is easy for your to tune details for your visualizations and most importantly, to replicate the same type of visualizations.  \n",

    "1. Of the 2015 cohort bachelor degree holders, what are their year 7 earnings distributions by major?\n",
    "2. Of the 2015 cohort bachelor degree holders, how does the missingness in year 7 earnings vary by major?\n",
    "3. Of the 2015 cohort bachelor degree holders, what are their earnings trends over time by major?\n",
    "4. Of the 2015 cohort, how does the year 7 median earnings vary by major and degree completion status (completer, non-completer, and degree pursuer)?\n",

    "**After completing this notebook, you should:**\n",
    "1. Learn how to create simple but informative visualizations\n",

    "A *boxplot*, also known as a *box and whisker plot*, is a graphical representation of statistical data. It usually includes five elements: minimum, first quartile (Q1, or the 25th percentile), median (Q2 or the 50th percentile), third quartile (Q3 or the 75th percentile), and maximum. The \"box\" in a boxplot encompasses the interquartile range (IQR), which spans Q1 to Q3. The \"line\" inside the box indicates the median. The \"whiskers\" extend from the box to show the range of the data (from min to max), but typically only up to 1.5 times the IQR. Any data points beyond the whiskers can be considered *outliers* and are often displayed as individual points. **Boxplots are useful in visualizing the spread and skewness of data and in spotting outliers.** Comparing boxplots allows for an easy comparison of these characteristics across different categories or groups in a dataset."

The bar plot could have different formats of input data: lists, numpy arrays, or pandas series object, which can be directly allocated to the x, y, and hue parameters.
