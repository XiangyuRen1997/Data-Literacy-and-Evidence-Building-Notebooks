    "## Goals:\n",
    "Our overarching goal in this series of notebooks is **to examine job quality of the 2015 Syntucky cohort**. In the Data Exploration notebook, we learned how to import the cohort data, how to subset the cohort data by major and degree levels, and how to generate descriptive statistics for outcome variables, such as year 7 earnings. In this notebook, we will first **identify three groups of students: completers, non-completers, and degree-pursuers**. Then we will **develop job quality measurements** in order to compare labor market outcomes for students in these three groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The specific questions we seek to answer in this notebook are**:\n",
    "1. What percentages of the 2015 cohort are completers, non-completers, and degree pursuers? \n",
    "2. What measures can we use to examine year 7 job quality for completers, non-completers, and degree pursuers?\n",
    "3. Which group have higher job quality in year 7, completers, non-completers, or degree pursuers?\n",
    "4. How does job quality vary by major for completers, non-completers, and degree pursuers?\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing this notebook, you should:**\n",
    "1. Be able to identify different groups of students based on their degrees obtained and college enrollment status.\n",
    "2. Become familar with various job quality measures and be able to design measures based on your research needs.\n",
    "3. Learn how to measure job quality for different groups of students and students from different majors."

For example, in the previous analysis, we consider earnings from any job, even if someone only earned $100 from that job. However, we can put additional restrictions on the standard of high-quality jobs. In this section, we examine job quality by using three additional measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-Earnings Job**: Jobs that pay above a certain threshold. For example, yearly earnings from a full-time federal minimum wage job is $15,080 (7.25 dollars per hour, 2080 hours per year). We can define jobs that pay above this threshold as high-earnings jobs. However, you may raise the threshold based on other criteria, such as above living wages.\n",

Note that the condition `df_2015['year7_earnings'] > 15080` only returns `True` or `False`, depending on the values in `year7_earnings`. In Python, we can multipy the condition by 1 and Python converts the `True`/`False` values to `1`/`0`.  To calculate average earnings per employed quarter, we just need to divide total earnings in year 7, `df_2015['year7_earnings']`, by employment duration in year 7, `df_2015['year7_ct_qtrs_employed']`.\n",

    "Finally, we are also interested in job quality by major and group. For example, does a graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science earn more than a graduate with a bachelor's degree in education? For another example, if two students were both in computer science major, but one has a bachelor's degree and the other one has an associate's degree, which of them would have higher earnings in year 7?\n",

    "To answer these questions, for completers, we need to use `high_completion`, which includes the major associated with the highest degree a person earned. However, non-completers and degree pursuers do not have `high_completion` majors, since they did not earn a degree yet. In this case, we can use their first enrolled major, `first_enroll`.\n",

    "In the code below, we separate the completers, non-completers, and degree pursuers into two DataFrames. This way, it is easier for us to use the `groupby()` and `agg()` methods to generate descriptive statistics later. The operator `|` means `or` in Python."
